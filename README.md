### Application outlook:

#### Features:

#### Examples:


### Development process:

#### Deployment:

#### Limitations:
* **Using university CS server:** The requirements instruct us to use secured university server to create database and to launch the application in order to prevent collegues from checking our data and website. As a result, when we graduate, we are unable to access the web application without the server.
* **Authentication database on server:** We created and stored the authentication databse on the university server, including the schema and the details. As a result, current admin function may not work properly without configuration of authentication database.

#### Further improvements:
* **Launch the application on external server:** Put the current application on an external server to address limitations of using university server
* **Create authentication database:** Following the creation of server, for the website to function properly, creation of admin login authentication is required
* **Create a persistent dogs database:** Current data are stored, retrieved and outputed from json files; these data includes dog, booking, track and review details. Creation of persistent database will be more secured.
